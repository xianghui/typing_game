*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **Shadcn UI**: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (version 18 or later)
*   npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing_game.git
    cd typing_game
    ```
    (Note: If this project was directly generated by Cline, you can skip the cloning step and proceed from the `typing_game` directory.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd typing_game
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Game

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the game. If port 3000 is already in use, Next.js will typically suggest an alternative port (e.g., [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)).

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```
